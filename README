"A Minecraft Bukkit plugin that manages a clan and territory system."

A work in progress.

== Note to collaborators! ==
If you are importing anything that has "bukkit" in the path, you are designing
something wrong! The only Bukkit specific interaction should be taking place in
the zerothindex.clancraft.bukkit package.
